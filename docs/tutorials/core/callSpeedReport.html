<h1>CallSpeedReport - Call Methods per Second</h1>
<p>
The 
<a href="../../api/org/agilewiki/jactor2/core/messages/RequestBase.html#call()">call</a>
method is quite slow as it typically blocks the originating thread, 
allocates a thread to the target reactor,
creates a message and adds it to the concurrent linked queue of that reactor.
The message must then be dequeued and evaluated on the new thread.
The message is then updated with a response and the originating thread is woken up.
Fortunately the call method is not used very often!
</p>
<p>
<a href="CallSpeedReport.java">CallSpeedReport</a>
is a small program that will tell us just how fast the call method is.

<pre>
import org.agilewiki.jactor2.core.blades.misc.Printer;
import org.agilewiki.jactor2.core.facilities.Plant;
import org.agilewiki.jactor2.core.reactors.NonBlockingReactor;

public class CallSpeedReport {
    public static void main(final String[] _args) throws Exception {
        final long count = 1000000L;
        Plant plant = new Plant();
        try {
            Ponger ponger = new Ponger(new NonBlockingReactor(plant));
            final long before = System.nanoTime();
            long i = 0L;
            while (i < count) {
                i += 1;
                long j = ponger.pingSReq().call();
            }
            final long after = System.nanoTime();
            final long duration = after - before;
            SpeedReport.startAReq(plant, "Call Timings", duration, count).call();
        } finally {
            plant.close();
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
This benchmark is pretty straight forward. We call the ping request in a loop and then use SpeedReport to 
calculate and print the results:
</p>
<pre>
Call Timings
Test duration in nanoseconds: 5,090,523,001
Number of exchanges: 1,000,000
Exchanges per second: 196,443
</pre>
<p>
By themselves the numbers are pretty meaningless. These test results were done on a system with both a fast CPU and
fast RAM.
But we can compare these numbers to other methods to gauge relative performance.
