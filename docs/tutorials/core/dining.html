<h1>DiningPhilosophers - Pending Responses</h1>
<p>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem">Dining Philosophers</a> 
is a classic problem in concurrency.
Five philosophers sit at a table with 5 place settings and 5 forks. 
Spaghetti is served, but the philosophers will only eat when they have two forks.
The philosophers, once they have both forks, will eat a meal and then return the forks to the table before eating again.
Our objective here is to see how fast our philosophers can eat.

<h2>DiningPhilosopher</h2>
<p>
As we are implementing our solution to this problem without built-in delays or locks, we will use 
hungry philosophers who will eat as soon as they get both a left and right fork, put the forks back on the
table and then immediately try to pick up their forks and eat again. This differs a bit from other solutions where the philosophers
take time out to think when they can not immediately get a fork. 
<a href="DiningPhilosopher.java">Here</a> is the code used to model a hungry philosopher:

/*
Each philosopher has a seat at the table, and the seats are numbered from 0 through 4.
The DiningPhilosopher class implements a single public request, feastAReq, 
which returns the number of meals the philosopher ate once all the spaghetti was eaten.

The feast request executes a simple loop, calling eatAReq and ateSReq until eatAReq returns a result
of false--which indicates that there is no more food to eat.
